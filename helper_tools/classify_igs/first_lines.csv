Recently, I‚Äôve been loving these @gatsbychocolate bars, which are made with fresh, crunchy almond bits draped in velvety dark chocolate. I‚Äôm at that age of adulting where I love deeply flavorful and slightly bittersweet dark chocolates, and I love how this one is perfectly sweet and not diluted by the addition of excess milk or sugar. Best of all, each bar contains half the calories and a quarter of the sugar typically found in an average chocolate bar, and is keto-friendly! 

Thank you @gatsbychocolate for sending me so many chocolate bars to try! Definitely make sure to check out their products at your local @ralphsgrocery , whether you‚Äôre looking for an indulgent snack or an essential baking ingredient! #gifted

üçì coconut pudding with fresh strawberry: I‚Äôve been seeing this all over IG, and I just HAD to get this dessert! Their coconut pudding is super light and subtly sweet, and topped with a layer of freshly chopped fruits (your choice of mango or strawberry). 

üç† taro with fresh milk: loved how they used real taro paste for this drink, although I wish they used more (since this drink ended up being mostly milk). This drink also uses white boba, which is a healthier alternative to tapioca balls, and has a more light and crunch texture. Definitely recommend if you‚Äôre looking for a non-caffeinated drink!

üêØ brown sugar milk tea: definitely my favorite drink out of the trio, and it‚Äôs absolutely perfectly sweetened and creamy with 50% sweetness and light ice. Their boba is also super chewy and well made, and would definitely recommend adding it as a topping in other drinks! 

üçä super fruit green tea: highly recommend this drink if you want something a bit more natural and fruity! I loved how there were so many fresh fruits in the drink, and how the flavors of each fruit melded beautifully with the fragrance of the green tea. Would recommend getting this at 100% sweetness and light ice since this is a bit lighter in flavor compared to the other drinks!

Thank you @ateamuseum for such a SWEET invite to try out your drinks and desserts! Definitely make sure to check them out at both of their Milpitas and Sunnyvale locations, and support a small, local and Asian-owned business! #invite

SO unbelievably impressed with this beautiful (and yummy) Hawaiian-themed table for a friend‚Äôs birthday.

Also wanted to point out that these beautiful pineapple and pina colada cupcakes, mango mousse, mango cheesecake bites and coconut cake were all meticulously baked and decorated by the super talented 13 year old @daysydesserts . I‚Äôve had the honor of trying his treats a few months before, but these honestly blew me away again, especially with how authentic and fresh the mango-flavored mousse and cheesecake bites were!

I‚Äôve been a bit hesitant to attend or coordinate social events because of the recent uptick in COVID, so I was especially thankful for how COVID-safe, friendly and efficient the team from @sugarbloomcorner was, and how quickly they put me at ease, both in person and when planning for this over Instagram DM! 

Also wanted to point out that these beautiful pineapple and pina colada cupcakes, mango mousse, mango cheesecake bites and coconut cake were all meticulously baked and decorated by the super talented 13 year old @daysydesserts . I‚Äôve had the honor of trying his treats a few months before, but these honestly blew me away again, especially with how authentic and fresh the mango-flavored mousse and cheesecake bites were! Which treat are you grabbing from this table? üòã

Thank you to @sugarbloomcorner and @daysydesserts for the most party-pleasing setup ever! If you‚Äôre located in the Bay Area, definitely make sure to check out and support both of these local, small, and AAPI-owned businesses for all of your party-related needs! #gifted

I‚Äôm typically not a big fan of popcorn, but I loved how these snacks were so light and airy in terms of both flavor and texture. Each snack is certified Kosher, Whole Grain, Vegan (Salt flavor only), Gluten Free, All Organic and uses only non-GMO corn. Best of all, proceeds from every bag sold are donated to art programs in public schools!

Finally got to check out the hype about @tigerteaandjuice , and I was definitely impressed with how deeply flavorful and high quality their drinks are! Here‚Äôs what I got to try:

‚ú® taro milk tea (with sea salt cream add-on): I‚Äôm typically hesitant to get taro at most boba shops (although it‚Äôs one of my favorite milk tea flavors), but I decided to go out on a limb here, and I‚Äôm so glad I did! They use real taro paste, which melds perfectly with the fresh milk when you mix it together! Definitely recommend if you‚Äôre looking for a non-caffeinated beverage. 

‚ú® brown sugar boba milk tea (with potted plant add-on): definitely a solid option for a drink that you can‚Äôt go wrong with! I loved how this drink was not overly sweet and had such a prevalent brown sugar flavor, even when I didn‚Äôt bump down the sweetness! 

‚ú® matcha latte (with potted plant add-on): Would highly recommend adding the potted plant, as it gives this drink a lot more dimension and sweetness, while still maintaining a definite taste of matcha. 

Thank you @tigerteaandjuice for inviting me to try out these drinks! Make sure to check them out at their SJ location- you definitely won‚Äôt be disappointed with the quali-TEA of their drinks! #invite

WONDER black bamboo mist from @official_haruharu : this mist is meticulously formulated from a pure blend of fermented black bamboo and bamboo shoot extracts, as well as phyllostachys nigra leaf extract. It did have a very strong herbal scent (which I‚Äôm not exactly the biggest fan of), but it surprisingly did not irritate my skin and works really well as a priming or refreshing spray!

Panda‚Äôs Dream white sleeping mask from @tonymoly.us_official : I actually ordered one of these before this box, because honestly who can resist this cuteness? ü•∫ I typically use this cream for the last step of my skincare routine, and I love how it absorbs easily into my skin and has such a nice clean fragrance! 

Pure Cleansing Oil from @manyofactory_us : I‚Äôve been a big fan of cleansing oils since they‚Äôre so much more effective at removing makeup, and this one definitely doesn‚Äôt disappoint! Unlike my current cleansing oil, you don‚Äôt even need to mix water to remove your makeup, and it does such an AMAZING and quick (literally 2 second) job at removing even my waterproof eyeliner! Highly recommend if you‚Äôve been looking for a new makeup remover!

D.N.A. Hydrating protein sheet masks from @medihealus @mediheal_official : I‚Äôm always in love with Mediheal‚Äôs masks (especially with how gentle and refreshing they are), and these are absolutely perfect for summer. These cellulose sheets are formulated with 19 different amino acids and peptides, as well as sodium hyaluronate and aquaxyl to replenish and hydrate the skin!

Y‚Äôall know I‚Äôm a sucker for a good pasta sauce, and these authentic Italian sauces from Chef Gino Angelini definitely do not disappoint! I TOTALLY can see why @justinbieber and @haileybieber love these- each product is USDA certified and gluten-free, and they even have flavors that are certified organic, vegan, and non-GMO! Best of all, these sauces are lovingly and meticulously concocted from only the finest Italian tomatoes, extra virgin olive oil, and fresh vegetables, and you can definitely taste the difference ü•∞

Thank you @ginoangelinifoods for sending me so many yummy sauces to try! Make sure to check out their products on @amazon or your local retailer and bring a taste of @angeliniosteria and Italy back to your own home! What would you make with this? #gifted

Trust me when I say the inside of the cake is as beautiful and delicious as it looks on the outside! The cake was so light and fluffy that it had me floating on CLOUD nine, and the fresh berries and vanilla buttercream added the most subtle and perfect touch of sweetness.

These noodles are absolutely perfect no matter your dietary restrictions- they‚Äôre low calorie, low carb, gluten free, and Keto friendly! Best of all, it literally takes only ONE minute to serve these up!

Recipe (serves 2):
1. Boil water (you can also simultaneously cook your ingredients like I did)!
2. Dispose of the water in the noodle package and thoroughly rinse and drain the noodles. 
3. Add in the sauce packet, dry toppings, boiled water, and any extra toppings you want. Wait one minute for the noodles to cook before enjoying your meal!

https://www.instagram.com/p/CSFM9jhpGM8/,"Nothing beats a sweet refreshing treat on a (G)LAZY summer day. So happy that I decided to ROLL up and try rolled ice cream for the first time @glazierrolls !

Pictured here is the purple rain flavor, which is made from a delicious and oh so BERRY creamy concoction of fresh blackberries, honey, lavender, and whole milk ice cream. Personally, I loved how rolled ice cream has a much more chewy texture (compared to soft serve or ice cream scoops) and melts a lot more slowly (due to the re-freezing step), which is just perfect when you‚Äôre trying to take your time and enjoy a sweet treat on a hot day. 

Would you give this a try? üòã

Thank you @glazierrolls for such a SWEET invite! Definitely make sure to check out their locations in Los Gatos and San Francisco if you‚Äôre craving some rolled ice cream + boba! #invite

Currently getting my glow on with @manyofactory_us , an award-winning and dermatologist-tested Korean skincare beauty line that will be launching SOON in the United States! Here are some of the items I got to try:

üçÉ Pure Cleansing Oil: I‚Äôve been a big fan of cleansing oils since they‚Äôre so much more effective at removing makeup, and this one definitely doesn‚Äôt disappoint! Unlike my current cleansing oil, you don‚Äôt even need to mix water to remove your makeup, and it does such an AMAZING and quick (literally 2 second) job at removing even my waterproof eyeliner! Highly recommend if you‚Äôve been looking for a new makeup remover!

üçÉ Galactomy Essence Cream: loved how this moisturizer was so light and hydrating! I have oily skin, and unfortunately, most moisturizers sit on top of my skin and leave an unpleasant greasy residue. This cream absorbs into my skin so easily, and leaves me hydrated and non-oily for almost the entire day. Highly recommend if you have a similar skin type or need as mine! 

üçÉ Bifida Biome Ampoule Toner and Mask: personally loved how these products were supplemented with an uniquely blended bifida biome and 5 different probiotic ingredients to help protect the skin‚Äôs barrier. These products are also super hydrating, and don‚Äôt have a harsh chemical smell or feeling like some other toners have. Would recommend these products if you‚Äôre prone to environmentally influenced breakouts like I am!

Thank you @manyofactory_us and @manyofactory_official for sending me so many new skincare goodies to try! Even my mom thought there was a huge transformation in the texture and appearance of my skin, and she even asked to borrow some of the products for herself üòÇ Definitely make sure to check out their US launch and get your hands on all of their award winning products! #gifted

https://www.instagram.com/p/CR667lTl9Lg/,"Unpopular opinion: instead of hot girl summer, can we have hot GLOW summer?

Currently getting my glow on with @manyofactory_us , an award-winning and dermatologist-tested Korean skincare beauty line that will be launching SOON in the United States! Here are some of the items I got to try:

üçÉ Pure Cleansing Oil: I‚Äôve been a big fan of cleansing oils since they‚Äôre so much more effective at removing makeup, and this one definitely doesn‚Äôt disappoint! Unlike my current cleansing oil, you don‚Äôt even need to mix water to remove your makeup, and it does such an AMAZING and quick (literally 2 second) job at removing even my waterproof eyeliner! Highly recommend if you‚Äôve been looking for a new makeup remover!

üçÉ Galactomy Essence Cream: loved how this moisturizer was so light and hydrating! I have oily skin, and unfortunately, most moisturizers sit on top of my skin and leave an unpleasant greasy residue. This cream absorbs into my skin so easily, and leaves me hydrated and non-oily for almost the entire day. Highly recommend if you have a similar skin type or need as mine! 

üçÉ Bifida Biome Ampoule Toner and Mask: personally loved how these products were supplemented with an uniquely blended bifida biome and 5 different probiotic ingredients to help protect the skin‚Äôs barrier. These products are also super hydrating, and don‚Äôt have a harsh chemical smell or feeling like some other toners have. Would recommend these products if you‚Äôre prone to environmentally influenced breakouts like I am!

Thank you @manyofactory_us and @manyofactory_official for sending me so many new skincare goodies to try! Even my mom thought there was a huge transformation in the texture and appearance of my skin, and she even asked to borrow some of the products for herself üòÇ Definitely make sure to check out their US launch and get your hands on all of their award winning products! #gifted

Similar to tofu, bean curd (or fupi, as it‚Äôs known in Chinese) is a fermented soybean product that is traditionally eaten as a yummy dish by itself, or as a topping for congee or hotpot. @fupi.co transforms this traditional dish into a crispy, convenient and vegan-friendly snack that comes in tomato hot pot and sichuan mala flavors. Even better, they‚Äôre so much more healthy than your traditional chips, with all the benefits of fermented soybean products, as well as no preservatives. 

Thank you @fupi.co for sending me all these goodies to munch on as I prepare for upcoming exams! Make sure to check these snacks out on @foodiefoodsus - you (and your stomach) definitely won‚Äôt be disappointed!

Introducing @drinktastea ‚Äòs new ube milk tea drink, crafted from a rich, creamy blend of ube, coconut foam, and freshly brewed black tea. I‚Äôm typically a bit hesitant to jump on the ube hype, but this drink is seriously SO well-made, and definitely among my new favorites on the menu. Personally, I love how the coconut foam is super subtle in flavor, yet beautifully elevates and brings out the natural flavors of the ube. This drink is ABSOLUTELY perfect if you‚Äôre a big fan of deeply flavorful and super creamy milk teas!

Dedicating today‚Äôs post to the BEST chicken katsu curry that I‚Äôve ever tried, from Shef Maria, aka @na_na_sf ! I‚Äôve had my fair share of Japanese curry, and honestly, nothing holds up to this. I personally loved how this sweet, slightly spicy, and immensely creamy curry was such a beautiful medley of both Japanese and Southeast Asian influences. Shef Marina incorporates traditional elements such as pineapples, carrots, Japanese sweet potato, and green bell peppers, which pairs so deliciously with the crispy chicken katsu. One of the most understated difficulties of mastering curry is the cooking time, and trust me- the potatoes, carrots, chicken katsu, and rice are ALWAYS cooked to literal perfection. 

If you‚Äôd like to try this meal out for yourself to see what the hype is all about and support home Shefs like Marina in their cooking endeavors, make sure to check out @ordershef and use my code ‚ÄúLVCIAEATS15‚Äù for $15 off.

Thank you @kitchenunitedmix for inviting me to try @anqisns , @vietnoms_sj and @rbteavf , some of the newest additions to @westfieldvf ! Make sure to check out my reel to see how easy it is to order from 10+ restaurants on their website for easy and convenient curbside/locker pickup or delivery! #invite #kitcheunitedmix

From @vietnoms_sj :

Lemongrass chicken vermicelli bowl ($14): honestly can‚Äôt describe how refreshing this dish was! The chicken is grilled and marinated so perfectly, and I love how the flavors of the meat and egg roll are subtly balanced out with the vermicelli noodles and fresh greens. 

Beef pho ($14): really loved how flavorful and comforting this dish was as well! I‚Äôve definitely tried a fair share of different pho restaurants, but I was really impressed with how rich the broth was, as well as the quality and quantity of the toppings and noodles. 
‚Äî
From @anqisns :

An‚Äôs famous garlic noodles ($13): totally understanding the hype behind these noodles after finally trying them. I love how they have that smoky pan-fried flavor, but I would definitely recommend paying a bit more and getting the prawns added!

Thank you @eureka_santaclara for inviting me and my entire family to the soft opening! Among the highlights of this meal:

Wings: Totally understand why these are SO hyped up! I got the orange Chile glazed wings and Eureka! Bourbon smoked dry rub wings, and both flavors were soooo insanely delicious with how perfectly crispy and tender the skin and meat was. Definitely a must get!

28 day aged bone marrow burger: Make sure to get your hands on this if you‚Äôre able to! The patty was sooo tender and juicy, and the bone marrow shiitake butter added such a beautiful new dimension of flavor that really brought out the natural flavors of the beef. Don‚Äôt sleep the fries either- they‚Äôre also perfectly crispy and seasoned! Highly recommend also getting this!

While these two dishes were definitely the star of the show, I was also impressed by their non-red meat options, which included the Napa grilled chicken sandwich, spicy fried chicken sandwich, and blackened salmon kale Caesar salad.

https://www.instagram.com/p/CRE1F7-FMD_/,"Dinner delivered, fresh off the SUSHI boat! 

Thank you to @cravveapp and @chowbus_official x @chowbusbayarea for this delicious feast! As usual, I‚Äôm SO excited to share a few discount codes with you:
‚ÄúLUCIA22‚Äù for $10 off (no minimum), first time users only
‚ÄúCRAVVE10‚Äù for $10 off a $20+ order!

üìçSushi Express, San Jose 

C3 combo: comes with 24 pieces total- 8 California roll, 8 shrimp tempura roll, and 8 caterpillar roll, for only $22.75! The caterpillar roll was definitely my favorite (as I‚Äôm such a huge fan of unagi), but I really loved how fresh and well put together these other rolls were! Highly recommend if you want to stay with a fully cooked option or within your comfort zone!

Unagi: honestly, I was impressed with how great the price point was -  you get 3 whole pieces for only $6.95, and they definitely don‚Äôt skimp on the size nor the quality!

Thank you to @cravveapp and @chowbus_official x @chowbusbayarea for this delicious feast! As usual, I‚Äôm SO excited to share a few discount codes with you:
‚ÄúLUCIA22‚Äù for $10 off (no minimum), first time users only
‚ÄúCRAVVE10‚Äù for $10 off a $20+ order!

üìçSushi Express, San Jose 

C3 combo: comes with 24 pieces total- 8 California roll, 8 shrimp tempura roll, and 8 caterpillar roll, for only $22.75! The caterpillar roll was definitely my favorite (as I‚Äôm such a huge fan of unagi), but I really loved how fresh and well put together these other rolls were! Highly recommend if you want to stay with a fully cooked option or within your comfort zone!

Unagi: honestly, I was impressed with how great the price point was -  you get 3 whole pieces for only $6.95, and they definitely don‚Äôt skimp on the size nor the quality! I loved how fresh the unagi was, but the unagi sauce was a bit lackluster for me personally. Nevertheless, definitely such a solid option, and would highly recommend if you‚Äôre looking for nigiri that isn‚Äôt raw!

Lemon shrimp onigiri: you know I love my shrimp, and this flavor really doesn‚Äôt miss! I love how the lemon gives the onigiri a modern, fusion take with a tangy and fresh aftertaste that really brings out the freshness of the shrimp. 

Wasabi slaw onigiri: I never had wasabi slaw before, but trust me - it‚Äôs so good! The wasabi is pretty subtle and gives the slaw such an unique and spicy kick. Definitely worth a try! 

Lemon shrimp bowl: I‚Äôm honestly such a sucker for salad/rice bowls, and I loved how loaded this one was with fresh greens, shrimp, slaw, edamame, and seaweed salad. Would highly recommend if you‚Äôre leaning towards something cooked/not feeling poke!

I seriously don‚Äôt know how to ESPRESSO how amazing their coffee is- I‚Äôm usually not a fan of cold brew (even at those $6 for a smol cup kind of fancy coffee shops), but I was soo impressed with how rich, deeply flavorful and smooth my cup of coffee was. Better yet, every product is certified 100% organic, has no added sugar, and is crafted with the intention of transparency and sustainability in mind. 

Thank you so much to @wanderingbearco for gifting me with seriously some of the best cold brew I‚Äôve ever had in my life. If you would like to check out their products as well, make sure to use my code ‚ÄúLVCIAEATS‚Äù for $$$ off your purchase on their website! #gifted

Introducing #BluehouseSalmon , a heart healthy and eco-positive protein superfood. Raised onshore in the Sunshine State, every fish is certified antibiotic and hormone free, non-GMO, and sushi-grade. As someone who has made an Earth Day resolution to be more conscientious of my non-sustainable consumption habits, @bluehousesalmon is definitely perfect for me, as well as for the planet!

Thank you to @bluehousesalmon for gifting me with the opportunity to try my first certified Heart-Check salmon! My mom and I whipped up our own version of #BluehouseRecipes using a homemade sauce made from mirin, soy sauce, and a little bit of black vinegar for #SalmonSaturday . You definitely can taste the difference with how fresh, tender and flavorful the fish is! What would you make with this? #gifted #BluehouseMoments

Sharing my newest obsession- mini mochi muffins and mochi madeleines! If you haven‚Äôt jumped on the hype yet, you absolutely have to  try out these perfectly buttery and chewy bites of heaven üòã My favorite flavor was definitely the Ube, which was just absolutely refreshing and melted in my mouth, but the matcha and the lemon flavors are also really well made from only the freshest, highest quality, and most authentic AAPI-inspired ingredients. What flavor would you like to try?

Thank you so much to Gloria from @mochicrumblette for gifting me with so many sweet snacks to try! It was such an honor being able to finally experience her insane baking talents firsthand, and you can definitely taste how much effort and time she pours into her creations. Bay Area friends- make sure to check out and support a local, AAPI and womxn-owned business- your taste buds and stomach definitely won‚Äôt regret it! #gifted

Spilling the deetz on how you can score this PHO-nomenal FEAST for yourself! Introducing @clubfeast , a food delivery app where you can schedule meals from your favorite local restaurants for ONLY $6.99 per meal + delivery for $0.49-$2.50 (and at no additional charge to the restaurant)! Make sure to use my code ‚Äúlucia2‚Äù for $20 off (basically three free meals)! Thank you @cravve_app and @clubfeast for setting this up! #collab

Now onto the review- I was honestly so blown away by how amazing this meal was from @phonomenal_asianfusion , especially for the quality and portion size I received! This is definitely one of my new favorite Asian comfort food restaurants in SJ, and I highly recommend checking them out if you‚Äôre looking to get a REALLY good meal and the bang out of your buck!

Beef pho - Personally, I really loved how deeply flavorful and comforting this dish was. I didn‚Äôt expect to get such an assortment of brisket and meatballs which was definitely a nice surprise, but I did find the portion a bit small, although not at the price I got it for!

Garlic noodles - Thought this dish was a bit misleading on how it was advertised- personally, I found it more of a chow mein dish as it barely had any garlic flavor. Nevertheless, it is made really well, and they give you SO many toppings!

Pad Thai - Loved how authentic, fresh and loaded this dish was! FYI it does come already with added spice and a really good amount of shrimp, eggs and tofu- no need to request to add these toppings on as extras!

Make sure to use my code ‚Äúlucia2‚Äù for $20 off (basically three free meals)! Thank you @cravve_app and @clubfeast for setting this up! #collab

Now onto the review- I was honestly so blown away by how amazing this meal was from @phonomenal_asianfusion , especially for the quality and portion size I received! This is definitely one of my new favorite Asian comfort food restaurants in SJ, and I highly recommend checking them out if you‚Äôre looking to get a REALLY good meal and the bang out of your buck!

Beef pho - Personally, I really loved how deeply flavorful and comforting this dish was. I didn‚Äôt expect to get such an assortment of brisket and meatballs which was definitely a nice surprise, but I did find the portion a bit small, although not at the price I got it for!

That‚Äôs why these noodles from @sesanood are perfect for me- they taste like a blend of these two traditional dishes, and they‚Äôre super easy to whip up! Even my parents thought that these noodles conjured up fond, nostalgic memories of dishes they tried at street stalls (lu bian mian) or night markets. 

Thank you to @sesanood for sending me so many packs of sesariginal and say spicy noodles all the way from Taiwan to try! Here, I topped my noodles with some sesame oil, green onions, seaweed flakes, and a fried egg. What would you like to pair with these noodles? 

Thank you also to @sweesedotcom for gifting me with the Porcelain Salad Bowl set! I was honestly so impressed with how high quality their products were- each piece was beautifully and perfectly crafted, with no chips or defects in production or shipping. Best of all, they‚Äôre also microwave, oven and dishwasher safe. Make sure to check out their products on Amazon!

Pureheals Ginseng Berry 80 Overnight Mask: Made from a specially formulated 80% ginseng berry extract, this overnight mask is intended to refresh and re- energize skin so you wake up looking dewy and glowy. I‚Äôve actually been looking for a night cream, and this product is PERFECT for me- it absorbs so quickly and seamlessly into my skin, and locks in all the toner and serum products that I use in my skincare routine. It also has a subtle fragrance that reminds me of blueberries, but it‚Äôs honestly so lovely that I don‚Äôt really mind!

Haruharu WONDER Black Rice Hyaluronic Cream: Can‚Äôt describe how impressed I was with this award winning cream- it‚Äôs light, hydrating, and contains refreshing toner packed with nourishing ingredients. I‚Äôve been using this one as a day cream, and I love how it helps condition the skin and prepare for optimal absorption of my daytime skincare products. Better yet, it‚Äôs non-greasy, has a lovely and subtle lavender fragrance, and the smallest amount goes such a long way when it comes to moisturizing my skin for the entire day. 

Mediheal Collagen Intensive Lifting Cleansing Foam: You already know I love my Mediheal cleansers, and this one for sure doesn‚Äôt disappoint! This cleanser is formulated to be a moisture-rich foam that is full of fortifying ingredients like collagen, elastin, and squalane to keep your skin looking plump and firm. It also contains rejuvenating ingredients such as vitamin E and green tea, which helps with keeping my skin moist, plump and rejuvenated after washing my face. Definitely is a solid choice for a cleanser if you‚Äôre looking for something comforting and gentle on a day-to-day basis!

You know I‚Äôm a sucker for easy to prep meals, and these @nonalimfoods definitely take quick to a whole new level! Each pack comes with all the noodles and sauces you need, as well as simple cooking instructions and suggestions for toppings to make the perfect gourmet noodle dish! Better yet, all of their noodles are certified vegan, non-GMO and dairy-free, and all of their kits are preservative-free and temperature-chilled to ensure freshness. 

Here, I whipped up the Teriyaki Ramen Stir Fry kit, which comes with my favorite teriyaki sauce, @trybachans ! I was honestly so surprised by how perfectly chewy the noodles were, and how well the sauce melded with the veggies and shrimp I added.

You know I‚Äôm a sucker for easy to prep meals, and these @nonalimfoods definitely take quick to a whole new level! Each pack comes with all the noodles and sauces you need, as well as simple cooking instructions and suggestions for toppings to make the perfect gourmet noodle dish! Better yet, all of their noodles are certified vegan, non-GMO and dairy-free, and all of their kits are preservative-free and temperature-chilled to ensure freshness. 

Here, I whipped up the Teriyaki Ramen Stir Fry kit, which comes with my favorite teriyaki sauce, @trybachans ! I was honestly so surprised by how perfectly chewy the noodles were, and how well the sauce melded with the veggies and shrimp I added. Their Pad Thai kit was also equally delicious, and I loved how quick and easy it was to make compared to Pad Thai recipes that I‚Äôve tried before.

Introducing @nudemints , the world‚Äôs first comprehensive oral and digestive tract nanocapsule cleanser. Designed to target the three main causes of halitosis, Nude Mints are able to cleanse both the tongue (through an outer capsule that pops and activates the salivary glands within three seconds of consumption) and the gut (through a smaller inner capsule that is swallowed). Definitely is SO impressive how the freshness from one little mint can persist for over 3 hours!

Thank you @nudemints for sending me the berry kiss, citrus squeeze, lemon drop (my favorite), mad melon, sexy spearmint and ice shot flavors to try! Make sure to check them out and let me know how you like them! #gifted

https://www.instagram.com/p/CPjBL4IFvsJ/,"Happy Memorial day! Hope all of you are having a RICE long weekend as we remember and commemorate all those who have served this country. 

Growing up, I often started my day or spent my lunchtimes munching on my mom‚Äôs fan tuan (rice balls). The onigiri from @onigilly certainly brings back fond memories of what a labor of love it is to mold and make these. I was able to try the spicy shrimp, miso beef (my favorite) and ginger beef, but all of the flavors were seriously so simple and comforting!

I also got to try the tuna poke bowl, which was so delicious and fresh! I especially loved how the fish had a tangy, slightly spicy sauce that melded perfectly with the sweetness of the vegetables and imitation crab. Definitely is super filling and worth for the price, and would highly recommend getting it from here for how fresh and high quality the ingredients are!

The matcha cheese cake is also a MUST get! @onigilly is definitely known for their onigiri, but don‚Äôt sleep on their desserts. Loved how insanely creamy, cheesy and perfectly sweetened this little slice of heaven was!

I‚Äôm beyond thankful for the opportunity to work with @cuddlecoveco , an organization that is committed to making the world a better place for domestic abuse victims and their families. 25% of proceeds (and 100% of proceeds two months out of the year) are donated towards their passion-fueled mission of ending domestic violence, particularly in regions disproportionately affected by intimate partner and domestic violence, such as Alaska and Saskatchewan.

One of my favorite ways to start my day is with a big, hearty bowl of my favorite @ellenosyogurt topped with fruits, nuts, and of course- granola! That‚Äôs why these gourmet granolas from @oatcuisine are perfect for me- not only are they made from organic oats, but they‚Äôre also loaded with dried fruits and assorted nuts for the perfect serving of protein and fiber to start the day. You can definitely taste the difference- their oats are SO crunchy, fresh and flavorful compared to so many other brands that I‚Äôve tried in the past.

I‚Äôve been starting my work days with @fabulacoffee , a healthy, certified-organic, low-acid and non-GMO coffee. As someone who tends to be sensitive to coffee, I loved how their low-acid coffee was sooo smooth and easy on my stomach- I definitely did not experience any cramping, bloating or jitters even after finishing a full cup. You can also definitely smell and taste the difference- even the light roast has such a beautiful, fragrant and earthy scent of fresh coffee. Furthermore, @fabulacoffee is built upon a mission that is close to heart- all their products are certified to be acquired from a single origin and through fair trade.

No better way to start your day by cooking up a healthy and delicious breakfast! For brunch, I decided to go with the Gluten-Free and whole grain baking and pancake mix from @pamelasproducts , a small, womxn-founded business that specializes in gluten-free products for consumers with dietary restrictions or allergies. This mix in particular was perfect, as it is made with almond meal, which is actually one of my favorite nuts!

Recipe (makes 9 pancakes):
1 cup of Pamela‚Äôs baking and pancake mix
1 large egg
2/3 cup water
1 TBSP oil

Mix all ingredients until there are no lumps, and add water if a thinner batter consistency is desired. Pour 1/4 cup batter into a preheated, lightly oiled pan at medium heat, and flip once. Make sure to add your favorite chocolate chip/fruit toppings, and drizzle with your favorite syrup!

https://www.instagram.com/p/CPBgk7xlerX/,"If you‚Äôve been looking for a new hot sauce, I GOTCHU!

Introducing the new GOTCHU hot sauce by @bibigousa . You already know that I‚Äôm a big fan of Bibigo, and honestly GOTCHU doesn‚Äôt disappoint either! Inspired by traditional Gochujang flavors, GOTCHU has an unique and deliciously complex slow heat profile that adds a subtle and comfortable dimension of spice to whatever you add it to. Here, I‚Äôve paired it with my favorite dumplings, but they also go amazing with kimchi fried rice, chicken, eggs, vegetables and pizza! What would you like like to try this on?

Thank you so much to @bibigousa and @matterfulbrands for including me in this launch! Make sure to check out GOTCHU for FREE for a LIMITED time only at BibigoGotchu.com, and let me know what you think! #gifted #collab #WeGotchu #GotchuHotSauce #SlowHeat #SlowHeatIsHot #DeliciouslyComplex #Bibigo #BibigoUSA #hotsaucelover #hotsauceaddict #hotsauceoneverything #CaliFinds #TasteThisSauce #hotsauce #hotsauces #gochujang #dumplings #dumpling #dumplingsfordays #gyoza #gyozalover #gyozas #bayareafoodie #subtleasianeats #subtleasiancooking #discover #discoverunder5k #explore #explorepage",191,382,Home ‚ô•,154880077873293,2021-05-18T18:00:17.000Z,,,Photo,,https://www.instagram.com/lvciaeats/,lvciaeats,Lucia | Bay Area Foodie,subtle asian traits,subtleasiantraits,Yelp,yelp,bibigo ·Ñá·Öµ·Ñá·Öµ·ÑÄ·Ö©,bibigo.official,Cravve | Food Review App,cravveapp,subtle asian cooking,subtleasian.cooking,BestFoodFeed,bestfoodfeed,Bibigo,bibigousa,Shef,ordershef,Subtle Asian Eats (SAE),subtleasianeats,Yelp Eats,yelpeats,Bay Area Foodie Crew,bayareafoodiecrew,BestFoodiesOfIG | OC | SF,bestfoodiesofig,BIBIGO INDONESIA,bibigo.id,https://scontent-lhr8-2.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/e35/p1080x1080/186923562_4087187944704529_1308828624286535743_n.jpg?_nc_ht=scontent-lhr8-2.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=101&_nc_ohc=ZvZ9X2_F3NwAX_Afm9e&tn=ob46zhWKa8jJNacd&edm=APU89FABAAAA&ccb=7-4&oh=5cda3f289eb0843d77a61fcc356352bb&oe=6127728A&_nc_sid=86f79a,2576483737404828375,2021-08-20T20:31:29.884Z,https://www.instagram.com/lvciaeats/,Matterful Brands,matterfulbrands,Bibigo Singapore,bibigosg,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PURELY no words to describe how excited I am to partner with @purelydrinks to gift one of you the same Purely Pop set consisting of the strawberry lemon, pineapple thai and grapefruit flavors! I‚Äôve been splashing a bit of this into my usual tea/lemonade drinks, and it‚Äôs definitely made a HUGE difference when it comes to my gastrointestinal health. Which flavor would you like to try? #gifted

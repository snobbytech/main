Going to just write some basic operational notes. More instructions incoming.


====================================================================
Ops/tech stack

Making this basic decision, because
  - Going to go with bare machines, because I know this better, and then a combination
    of GCP//flask//postgres//react.  The point of all this is to optimize for speed of deployment.


====================================================================

Style
Naming:
- Class names: CapitalizedNames like this
- Class variables: underscore_naming is best, because parsing longer names (esp with numbers) is tough.
- Local variables: camelCase is ok. It's faster.

I'm going to try and adhere to these myself, but I'll probably break them too.


====================================================================
Setting up the database.

To do local testing on the database, I did this:

# Start psql:
sudo -u postgres psql

# Inside psql:

postgres=# create database foodsnob;
CREATE DATABASE
postgres=# create user snob with encrypted password 'delicious';
CREATE ROLE
postgres=# grant all privileges on database foodsnob to snob;
GRANT

I installed dbeaver as a gui to keep up with my database entries:
  https://dbeaver.io/download/
  and connect to it with either the username above.

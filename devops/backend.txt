Backend:

I'm getting the dumbest possible thing, so I'm going to try and get an EC2 instance.

Setting it up with ubuntu 20.04 because the package manger is easier?

I'm not *really* sure what I'll need yet, but: Looks like t3g.small will cost us like 15/mo, which won't be too bad. So to start off, let me go with one of those?
It's got 2 cores, 2 gigs of memory, and up to 5 gigabit in network capacity. So, probably ok, not the best, not the worst. Let's go with that for now? We have 10k in credits anyway, and if I record how I do this I can probably get things faster.

- We could probably eventually go to AWS Lambda instead to handle autoscaling.

Anyway, I'm not even sure how our server's going to be pounded at the start, so let's just get something small and generic and I can set it up more correctly, later.


OK, so here's the full specs list:

ubuntu 20.04
t3.small instance
2 vcpus
2gb memory

Launching...

- Actually, I have to install/download a keypair before launching? I downloaded it.

Now, how do I run it?
https://us-east-2.console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home?region=us-east-2#LaunchInstanceWizard:

Connecting w/ SSH:
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AccessingInstancesLinux.html

==================================================================
All right! So now I finally get to it.  These guides are NOT written that well.

1) Download the private key - I did that upon creation, and you can yourself create a keypair here:
https://us-east-2.console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home?region=us-east-2#KeyPairs:keyName=snob-1-keypair

I have to chmod it:
chmod 600 snob-1-keypair.pem

The default username for ubuntu machines is just "ubuntu"

So, then, to ssh into our machine using our ipv4 address:
ssh -i snob-1-keypair.pem ubuntu@18.118.143.37

OK, I changed the password (though I guess they don't have one set):

sudo passwd:
changed it to "snob"

Anyway, I made it a bash alias so it's easy to get on.

Next step: I'll be installing basic packages on this machine.

Installations:
- tmux exists
- vim exists

Python isn't. Looks like people on reddit still recommend conda, so I'm going to install it from that.

- Made the appropriate vim, emacs, colors files.  Added my .vimrc and .emacs files.
- Installed miniconda:
  - wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh

- Grabbing our repo:
  - Made ssh key on the machine, and added the key to my github.

- Installed requirements.txt.
- I had to install gunicorn again?
- Go in /backend, create dirs for /instance and /config
- copy over the files in /config

Needed to install this because of psychop2
sudo apt-get install --reinstall libpq-dev

- Needed gcc:
sudo apt-get install gcc
Now I can install psycogp2

Cool. Now I can... do everything except the real database.

I'll be using Amazon RDS as a service here. Most of my database

- Looks like the cheap (dev) version of the db: $.24/hour.

database name:
foodsnob
master username: snob
pw: snobbysnob

The database url is:
foodsnob.cgw75bez6kmv.us-east-2.rds.amazonaws.com

(The endpoint name is
foodsnob.cgw75bez6kmv.us-east-2.rds.amazonaws.com
)


Those assholes. It's not documented. Fuck fuck fuck you.

OK. The tl;dr is that they don't document any of this shit and aws is god awful.
OK. So the things I had to end up doing were:

- Create the RDS instance. Do NOT use the easy install option.
  - Select that the db must be publicly available.
  - Go into the security rules option. Create a new security group.
    - Go into "edit inbound rules"
    - Type: PostgresSQL (before I had it on TCP)
      - Source type: all (0.0.0.0/0)

ALSO: when they create the db, the db created is called postgres, and not the dbname that you gave them.
Why is that? Who knows. Because amazon is all idiots and I hate them all.

Anyway, the final command is like:
psql --host=foodsnob.cgw75bez6kmv.us-east-2.rds.amazonaws.com --port=5432 --username=snob --password --dbname=postgres

- OK, and I verified: make_test_data works.

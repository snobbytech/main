Here's my running log as I'm reading up on frontend.

Actually, it seems like AWS Amplify is pretty sucks and limiting? That's annoying.

Well, let me try the Amplify thing anyway. I'm setting something up real quick...

I went to this place:
https://us-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/amplify/home?region=us-west-2#/create/manual

And chose the drag-and-drop deployment method after running npm run build.

# Cool, I guess this is now deployed, we have a semblance of a frontend now!

https://prod.d2om9hl2a5v7la.amplifyapp.com/

# Thatwaseasy. I think maybe for this thing S3 deployment might be cheaper in the long run, but we can think about that later.
